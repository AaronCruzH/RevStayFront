    The useEffect hook is a special function that allows you to create side effect functions that take place
    when the component mounts or a dependencies (state variable) gets changed

    When the component is rendered on the screen it MOUNTS to the dom (in dev mode this happens twice do not
    be alarmed)

    It's important to note that the useEffect can be called on certain dependencies when adding them to the 
    final array. It should be noted that this is a very quick way to create an infinite loop so be careful
